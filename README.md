# Optimizing-Client-Satisfaction-and-IT-Project-Delivery-Efficiency

## Description:
This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to identify factors
 causing IT project delays. Using synthetic data, a predictive model was trained,
 evaluated, and visualized to uncover delay patterns, enabling better project
 management and timely deliveries. The dataset was generated using the Faker
 library, cleaned, and split for training and testing. Insights from data visualization
 helped optimize workflows and improve decision-making in IT project
 management.

 ## Objectives
  The primary objective of this project is to analyze large datasets to identify key factors
 contributing to delays in IT companies handing over projects to clients. By leveraging
 data-driven insights, the goal was to improve project management efficiency and
 optimize delivery timelines
 ## Technologies used
 <ul>
    <li>Python – For data processing and model training</li>
 <li>Faker Library – To generate synthetic data for analysis</li>
 <li>Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and preprocessing</li>
 <li>Machine Learning Model – To predict project delays</li>
 <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization and insights</li>
 </ul>
 
 ## Development Process

 ### Step 1: Data Preparation:
 <ul>
   <li>Data Generation: Used the Faker library to create synthetic data, simulating
 real-world project details such as deadlines, resource allocation, and project
 phases.</li>
 <li>Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and
 standardized date formats.</li>
 <li>Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features such as project duration,
 team size, and historical delays.</li>
 </ul>

 ### Step 2: Data Splitting
 Features (X) and target (y) variables are separated. The dataset is split into 80%
 training and 20% testing sets using train_test_split().

 ### Step 3: Model Training and Evaluation

 To predict project delays, we trained and evaluate a machine learning model by following these
 steps:
 <li>Selected an Algorithm: Tried different models like Decision Trees, Random
 Forest, and Logistic Regression and train the model.</li>
 <li>Predictions are made on test data. MAE and MSE are calculated to measure the
 accuracy of the model</li>

 ### Step 4: Visualization
 To better understand insights from the data and model predictions, we visualized
 key aspects using:
 <li>Bar Charts & Histograms – Showed distributions of project delays.</li>
 <li>Scatter Plots – Identified correlations between project features and delay times.</li>
 <li>Heatmaps – Highlighted relationships between variables.</li>
 <li>Feature Importance Graphs – Demonstrated the most influential factors in predicting delays</li>
